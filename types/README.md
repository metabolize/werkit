Werkit is a toolkit for encapsulating Python-based computation into
deployable and distributable tasks.

This package publishes TypeScript types for the Werkit job message format.

After defining a type for your own code's results, you can use
[ts-json-schema-generator][] to generate JSON Schema for your specific result
type.
